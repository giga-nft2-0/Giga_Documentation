    **Giga Blocks** is a decentralized school directory platform developed in collaboration with UNICEF’s **Giga initiative**. It is designed to be the **world’s most transparent and accessible registry of school data**, leveraging **blockchain technology** for immutability and permanence.


    The platform ingests school data from the **Giga Maps API**, combining both **real-time indicators** (such as connectivity status, download/upload speed) and **static attributes** (such as electricity availability, number of students, number of teachers, or infrastructure metrics). This ensures that Giga Blocks always starts from an **authoritative and verified data source**.


    Key functionality includes:

* **School Activation**: Any user can activate a school by paying a base blockchain fee. This action stores selected school metadata permanently on-chain. \

* **Generative NFT Creation**: At activation, the system generates a unique **NFT artwork** (using p5.js) seeded by school-specific data. Users can personalize it with a theme before minting. \

* **Inclusive Onboarding**: Event-based **sponsored activations** let users support schools without paying directly. In this flow, users verify via email, and later claim their NFT by connecting a wallet. \

* **Contributor Recognition**: Activators are publicly acknowledged on the school profile page and within their personal dashboard, reinforcing ownership and visibility. \


    Giga Blocks is not only a directory but a **participatory Web3 movement**. By combining **open data, blockchain infrastructure, and public contribution**, the platform transforms each school profile into a **living digital asset**, raising awareness and supporting the global mission to connect every school to the internet.
