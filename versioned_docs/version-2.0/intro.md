# Welcome to the Giga Blocks Developer Documentation

Welcome to the official developer guide for **Giga Blocks** — the decentralized school directory platform. This documentation is your starting point for understanding, contributing to, and building on Giga Blocks, a project developed in partnership with UNICEF’s **Giga initiative**.

## What is Giga Blocks?

**Giga Blocks** is the world’s most transparent and accessible registry of school data, leveraging blockchain technology for data immutability and permanence.

## Key Features

- **Authoritative Data Source:**  
  School data is ingested from the official **Giga Maps API**, combining:
  - **Real-time indicators:** Connectivity status, download/upload speeds, etc.
  - **Static attributes:** Electricity availability, student/teacher counts, infrastructure metrics.

- **School Activation:**  
  Anyone can activate a school by paying a base blockchain fee. This action stores selected school metadata permanently on-chain.

- **Generative NFT Creation:**  
  Upon activation, a unique NFT artwork is generated (using p5.js), seeded by school-specific data. Users can personalize the NFT’s theme before minting.

- **Inclusive Onboarding:**  
  Sponsored activations allow users to support schools without direct payment. Users verify via email and later claim their NFT by connecting a wallet.

- **Contributor Recognition:**  
  Activators are publicly acknowledged on both the school profile page and their personal dashboard, reinforcing ownership and visibility.

## Why Giga Blocks?

Giga Blocks is more than a directory — it’s a participatory Web3 movement. By combining open data, blockchain infrastructure, and public contribution, every school profile becomes a living digital asset. This approach raises awareness and supports the global mission to connect every school to the internet.
